Topologies
 
A topology is a graph of computation. Each node in a topology contains processing logic, and links between nodes indicate how data should be passed around between nodes.[2]

1.   The work is delegated to different types of components that are each responsible for a simple specific processing task.
2.   The input stream of a Storm cluster is handled by s component called Spout.
3.   The sprout passes the data to a component called a Bolt, which transforms it in some way.
4.   A bolt either persists the data in some sort of storages, or passes it to some other bolt. [3]
